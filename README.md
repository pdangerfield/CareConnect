# Care Connect

## Description

Care Connect is a full stack web application that enables users to manage employee information within an organization.

Working on Care Connect allowed us to gain valuable experience with several key concepts including creating user friendly interface design, handling database operations, implementing security measures, validating user input, and working with a variety of technologies and libraries.
